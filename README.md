# Time Series Forecasting in R

## Overview

This project applies **time series analysis** techniques in R to predict **live birth statistics in the UK**. The goal is to build forecasting models using **ARIMA, SARIMA, and ETS** to analyse trends and make future predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, date formatting, and sorting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Trend analysis, moving averages, and visualisation.
- **Time Series Modelling**:
  - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
  - **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**
  - **ETS (Error, Trend, and Seasonality Model)**
- **Model Evaluation**: AIC, RMSE, residual diagnostics.
- **Forecasting & Validation**: Train-test split, accuracy comparison across models.

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `forecast`, `tseries`, `zoo`, `TTR`

## Usage

1. Open `task3.R` in RStudio.
2. Run the script step by step to **clean data, apply time series models, and generate forecasts**.
3. Compare model accuracy and visualise future trends.

## Results

- Provides **short-term and long-term forecasts** of UK birth rates.
- Identifies **seasonal and trend patterns** using advanced time series models.
